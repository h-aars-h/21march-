    "# Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",
    "# might choose one over the other.\n",
    "# Ans 1 Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are two popular techniques used to encode categorical variables in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordinal encoding is a technique of assigning a unique integer value to each category of a categorical variable. The values are \n",
    "# assigned in increasing order of the category's perceived importance or ranking. For example, suppose we have a categorical variable \n",
    "# \"Education\" with categories \"High School,\" \"College,\" and \"Graduate.\" In that case, ordinal encoding can assign values 1, 2, and 3\n",
    "# to these categories, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label Encoding, on the other hand, is a technique of assigning a unique integer value to each category of a categorical variable \n",
    "# without considering any ranking or order. For example, in the same \"Education\" example, label encoding can assign values 1, 2, and 3\n",
    "# to these categories, respectively, without considering any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In general, if there is a clear ranking or order in the categories, it is better to use ordinal encoding. On the other hand,\n",
    "# if there is no order or ranking among the categories, it is better to use label encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, suppose we have a categorical variable \"Star Rating\" with categories \"One Star,\" \"Two Star,\" \"Three Star,\" \"Four Star,\" \n",
    "# and \"Five Star.\" Since there is a clear ranking or order in the categories, it is better to use ordinal encoding. In contrast, \n",
    "# if we have a categorical variable \"Color\" with categories \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" we can use label encoding since there is no\n",
    "# clear order among the categories."

    "# Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",
    "# a machine learning project.\n",
    "# Ans 2:Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used for encoding categorical variables where the encoding is based on the relationship between the variable and the target variable. The idea behind this technique is to assign numerical values to the categories of the categorical variable such that the encoding reflects the relationship between the categories and the target variable.\n",

    "# Order the categories based on the mean of the target variable for each category.\n",
    "# Assign a numerical value to each category based on the order obtained in step 2.\n",
